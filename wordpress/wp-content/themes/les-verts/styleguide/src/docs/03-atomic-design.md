The architecture of our design system is based on the [atomic web design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles.

As Brad Frost wrote:

Or, if you're more into a playful mood, think about Lego for UI components ;-)

This styleguide is based upon these 3 layers of complexity:

**1. atoms**
**2. molecules**
**3. organisms**

_Atoms_ are the most basic, unbreakable building blocks of the design system: these are the little Lego colorful basic bricks.

_Molecules_ are atoms linked together: to build a wall for the castle of your dreams in your next Lego building project, you need to stack bricks on top of each other.

_Organisms_ are the highest order of web components, built by assembling molecules together. Organisms fulfill a purpose and form a complex view. For instance, the mobile menu itself is an organism that you can integrate into your environment.
