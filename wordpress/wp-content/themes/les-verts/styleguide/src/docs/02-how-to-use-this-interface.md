title: How to use this web interface
---

The web UI interface of this project is built upon [Fractal](https://fractal.build/guide).

The interface includes three parts:

- ← on the **left**, a sidebar that gives you direct **access to components and documentation**
- ➝ on the **right**, a **preview** of the current component or doc page
- ↓ on the **bottom** part of the preview pane, several **panels provide some more information** (*only available when previewing a component, won't show up on documentation pages*)

> **TIP**: If the bottom pane is hidden when previewing a component, drag the handle at the very bottom of the page to reveal it.

## Component panels

### HTML

As its name implies, this panel gives you get direct access to the full generated HTML markup.

### View

Displays the code for the view of the current component using the template rendering engine used to build it.

### Assets

Gives you access to the SCSS file and to the complete markup of the currently previewed component.

### Context

The rendered view of some components use some dynamic data. You will find them under this context panel.

### Info

This panel shows various information about the currently previewed component, including a very useful cross-linking list of the components (atoms, molecules…) used to build the current component; this list is available under the last section of the panel, namely 'REFERENCES').

### Notes

Might include some notes about the preview, design, code… etc.
For instance, some components have some specially added visual elements that embellish the preview; it will be written down here.
