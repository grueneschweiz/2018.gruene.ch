All class names include two parts:
---

### Atomic
1. 1-letter prefix based on the type of component:
	- **a-** for atoms
	- **m-** for molecules
	- **o-** for organisms
2. the rest of the class name based on the **B**lock **E**lement **M**odifier [convention](http://getbem.com/naming/), where the block and element are separated by a double underscore, and the element and modifier are separated by a double dash

### Utilities


In addition to the Atomic class name we included **utility** classes, which have **u-** as prefix.
These classes are meant to be reusable throughout the styleguide as base for some non atomic elements/styles.
