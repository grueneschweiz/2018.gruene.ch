## Using Sanuk Font
Since Sanuk has a very strict licence, we've bundled the free alternative Passion One Bold. 
To use Sanuk, upload it into the `wp-content` folder as follows:
```
wp-content/
  sanuk/
    font.eot
    font.ttf
    font.woff
    font.woff2
```
Verify, you name the files, exactly as above and you provide all those file formats.
